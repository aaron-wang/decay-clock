# Decay Clock
A productivity desktop application made using Electron, JavaScript, Node.js, CSS, Bootstrap, and HTML.

`Project created for EngHack 2021.`

Incremental alarms are set before a designated time, with frequency increasing exponentially.

<!-- > Having a proper alarm has never felt so painful!
>  
> Choose your alarm time, and you will have multiple alarms created leading up to that time

- *Alarm clocks are useful, but we are often guilty of hitting the snooze button and ignoring the alarm altogether.*

- *With an abundance of distractions in our homes, procrastination has become a severe issue among students.*
