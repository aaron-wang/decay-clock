# Decay Clock
Project created for EngHack 2021. A productivity app made using Electron, JavaScript, Node.js, CSS, Bootstrap, and HTML.

> Having a proper alarm has never felt so painful! Pick your alarm time, and multiple alarms are set up automatically leading up to that time, with frequency increasing exponentially.

Alarm clocks are useful, but we are often guilty of hitting the snooze button and ignoring the alarm altogether. With an abundance of distractions in our homes, procrastination has become a severe issue among students.

Decay Clock is a desktop application that sets incremental alarms before a designated time so that users will not be able to ignore it.

### Example

Currently 8:00 AM; user sets alarm for 9:00 AM

Alarms are set up as follows:
- 8:30
- 8:45
- 8:52
- 8:55
- 8:57
- ... etc.
